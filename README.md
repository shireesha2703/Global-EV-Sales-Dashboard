# Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes global Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends across regions, years, transport modes, and powertrain types using **Power BI**. The goal is to understand how EV sales, stock, and penetration have evolved over time and to compare adoption patterns across different categories such as cars, buses, trucks, and two-wheelers.

##  Objectives

* Analyze year-wise growth of EV sales and stock globally
* Compare EV adoption across regions and transport modes
* Study powertrain distribution (BEV, PHEV, Hybrid, ICE, etc.)
* Identify top regions and categories driving EV growth
* Support data-driven insights for sustainability and policy decisions

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key fields:

* **Region** – Country or geographic region
* **Year** – Time period of observation
* **Mode** – Transport mode (Road, Rail, etc.)
* **Category** – Vehicle category (Car, Bus, Truck, 2W, etc.)
* **EV Type** – Type of electric vehicle
* **Powertrain** – BEV, PHEV, Hybrid, ICE, etc.
* **EV Count / Sales / Stock** – Numerical indicator of EV adoption
* **Unit** – Measurement unit

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization
* **DAX** – Measures and calculated columns
* **Excel / CSV** – Data source (if applicable)

##  Key Analysis & Visuals

* Year-wise trend of global EV stock and sales
* Regional comparison of EV adoption
* Category-wise EV penetration analysis
* BEV vs PHEV trend comparison
* Top regions contributing to EV growth
* Powertrain usage across transport modes

##  Insights

* Road transport shows the fastest EV adoption compared to other modes
* BEVs dominate recent growth, especially after 2020
* EV adoption varies significantly between developed and developing regions
* Certain categories (cars and 2-wheelers) lead overall EV penetration
